# MLSecOps - DevSecOps - Awesome

This project is dedicated to curating a comprehensive list of resources, tools, and best practices at the intersection of Machine Learning Security Operations (MLSecOps), and Development Security Operations (DevSecOps). Our goal is to provide a centralized hub for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts who are passionate about integrating security into the development and deployment of machine learning systems.

## What is MLSecOps?

MLSecOps is an emerging field that focuses on the secure and efficient operation of machine learning models in production environments. It combines the principles of DevSecOps with the unique challenges of machine learning, emphasizing the importance of security, privacy, and compliance throughout the ML lifecycle.

## What is DevSecOps?

DevSecOps extends the traditional DevOps framework by incorporating security practices into the entire software development process. It aims to automate security checks and integrate them seamlessly into the CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that security is a fundamental part of the development workflow.

## Repository Overview

In this repository, you will find:

* Resources: Articles, papers, and tutorials on MLSecOps and DevSecOps.
* Tools: A curated list of open-source tools for securing ML models and development pipelines.
* Best Practices: Guidelines and methodologies for implementing security measures in ML projects.
* Case Studies: Real-world examples of successful MLSecOps and DevSecOps implementations.
* Community: Links to forums, conferences, and groups where you can connect with others interested in these fields.
